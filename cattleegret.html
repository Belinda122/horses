<h1>Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis)</h1>
<p> A small white bird that belongs to the heron family. 
    Native to Africa, southern Europe, and parts of Asia, 
    but can be found all around the world due to a 
    symbiotic relationship with livestock.</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>The relationship between cattle egrets and horses is 
an example of mutualism, where both parties benefit from 
the interaction. The cattle egret’s diet is mostly insectivorous, often 
eating insects stirred up by other animals. These insects 
can include pests that bother horses, like horseflies. The 
cattle egret will often perch on the horse’s back, gaining a vantage point 
and better access to pests.</p>

<p>Phylum: Chordata
Class: Aves
Order: Ciconiiformes
Family: Ardeidae
Genus: Bubulcus</p>
