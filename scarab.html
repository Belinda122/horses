<h1>Rainbow Scarab (Phanaeus vindex)</h1>
<p> A colourful, bulky beetle with a shiny exoskeleton. It is native to 
    North America and commonly found near pasture animals.
</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>The relationship between rainbow scarabs and horses is 
an example of mutualism, where both parties benefit from 
the interaction. The scarab eat and utilize horse dung for reproduction, and 
by doing so provide benefits to the ecosystem. They control the fly and parasite
population, recycle the nutrients in the dung, and clean fecal matter.</p>

<p>Phylum: Arthropoda
Class: Insecta
Order: Coleoptera
