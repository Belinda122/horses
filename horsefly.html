<h1>Horsefly (Tabanidae)</h1>
<p> A large, fast-flying insect known for its painful bite. Found 
    worldwide, it thrives in warm, humid environments, especially near 
    livestock. </p>

<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>The relationship between horseflies and horses is an 
    example of parasitism, where one party (the horsefly) benefits
     at the expense of the other. Female horseflies use the blood for 
     developing eggs and can cause pain, irritation, or the spread diseases 
     with their bite. They are also a source of food for many insect-eating 
     birds like cattle egrets and cowbirds.</p>
