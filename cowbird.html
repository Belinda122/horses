<h1>Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)</h1>
<p> A small bird with a brown coloured head and a black body. It is native to
    North America but is considered a nuisance due to it being a brood
    parasite.
</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>The relationship between the brown-headed cowbird and horses is 
an example of mutualism, where both parties benefit from 
the interaction. The cowbird is an omnivore who can eat seeds as well
as insects. These insects can include pests that bother horses, such as 
horseflies. They can perch on and follow horses to gain better access to 
insects.
