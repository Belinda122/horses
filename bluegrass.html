<h1>Bluegrass (Poa pratensis)</h1>
<p> Also known as Kentucky bluegrass. A species of grass that can be found in
    Europe, North Asia, and North America.
</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>
<p>The relationship between bluegrass and horses is 
an example of mutualism, where both parties benefit from 
the interaction. Bluegrass is a source of food for horses, and the act of 
grazing disturbs the soil and stimulates new, healthy growth. Horse fecal matter
also returns nutrients to the soil, aided by the activity of dung beetles like 
the rainbow scarab.</p>
